# Jump Regression: Matlab Implementation
This code implements the jump beta framework developed by [Li et al., 2016]<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>. Specifically, it implements the estimation of the efficient jump beta, its confidence interval, and the hypothesis test for a constant jump beta.   

The detailed explanation of the code is in the [pdf version of the README](https://github.com/Salompas/jump-regression/blob/master/README.pdf). The code is well commented, specially the functions. Let me know if you find any mistakes.
